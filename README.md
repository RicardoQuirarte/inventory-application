This app was created using Node.js and Express, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. For the database, I used PostgreSQL. I also incorporated modules and a bit of Bootstrap for a minimalist look.

The app supports all CRUD operations. I developed it as a project for a local nutritionist, thinking it could be useful in the real world. I created an inventory application for managing his patients.
